<h2>Send Campaign in Mailchimp or Campaign Monitor</h2>
<h3>Using 3rd party service</h3>
    <p>I recommend using one of the following 3rd party services to send campaigns - they are professionals, they know what they are doing, they guide you, they give clients access to live statistics and they are affordable.</p>
    <p>1. <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp: http://www.mailchimp.com/</a><br />
2. <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com">Campaign Monitor: http://www.campaignmonitor.com</a></p>
    <p>These options above are not the only companies offering sending services, and strickly speaking you do not need to use them - but they are recommended and I do not earn money from you using these services, and I am not affiliated with any of them in any way.</p>
